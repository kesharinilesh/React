// JS do not comes with JSX JS engine only understands ECMA scripts.
// JSX  is (converted)transpiled(Parcel-Babel (package))i.e, converts JSX into a react code before it reaches the JS engine or browsers so that they could understand)

//Babel is a Javascript compiler that does a lot of transpilation of Javascript code so that older versions could be able to understand.
//Parcel is the manager of babel

// React Component - Everything in React is a component(2 types: class based(old way of writing) and functional component(modern way))

    <h1> This is a react component</h1>
    </div>
) //-- valid for multiline element
// const Hc=()=><h1> This is a react component</h1>  -valid for single line code
// #above is the example of react component composition: combination of two components

// how to render react Component?
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);

//cross-site scripting: injection attacks from any malicious api with the intention to steal data from local storage or run anything in your browser but jsx takes care of all this. It sanitizes everything
